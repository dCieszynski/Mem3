# mem3
Mem3 is a 3 network website running on Rinkeby Testnet where you can post meme addresses and share them with other people. I created it with a blockchain technology, it is working on Rinkeby Testnet via Smart Contract that I wrote using Solidity programming language. Mem3 is in a really early version right now and it doesn't have all of the features that I would like to implement in the future.

### Why I created a mem3?
Mem3 is my first totally solo web3 project that i created without any tutorial. I built it to improve my skills, mostly to creating better smart contracts and as well as to learn much more about how frontend communicate with smart contracts.
